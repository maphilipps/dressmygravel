## Problem to solve

We need to implement a systematic Architectural Decision Records (ADR) system that:
1. Captures architectural decisions in a standardized format
2. Enforces ADR creation through mandatory hooks when architectural changes are detected
3. Integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows

## Proposed solution

Implement a complete ADR system with automated detection and mandatory workflow enforcement.

### Phase 1: Core ADR Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Directory Structure & Templates
```
.adrs/
├── template.md           # Standard ADR template
├── adr-001-example.md   # Example ADR
└── README.md            # ADR system documentation
```

#### 1.2 ADR Template Format
Based on Cognitect methodology:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local factors]

## Decision
We will [describe the response to these forces].

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision]
```

#### 1.3 ADR Creation Tooling
- Script/command for generating new ADRs with proper numbering
- Template population with boilerplate content
- Integration with editor for easy editing

### Phase 2: Hook System for Automated Detection

#### 2.1 Hook Integration Points
- **Git pre-commit hooks**: Detect architectural changes in commits
- **CI/CD pipeline hooks**: Detect architectural changes in PRs  
- **Task completion hooks**: Integration with existing workflow

#### 2.2 Detection Logic
Identify ADR-worthy changes by analyzing:
- **File patterns**: Changes to architecture-critical files
  - `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod` (dependencies)
  - Docker files, deployment configurations
  - Database schemas, migration files
  - API definitions, interface changes
- **Code patterns**: 
  - New major dependencies
  - Significant architectural patterns (new services, major refactors)
  - Infrastructure changes
- **Size/complexity**: Large PRs that might contain architectural decisions

#### 2.3 Hook Implementation Strategy
```bash
# Git hooks integration
.git/hooks/pre-commit          # Check for ADR-worthy changes
.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg  # Prompt for ADR if needed

# CI/CD integration  
.github/workflows/adr-check.yml # GitHub Actions workflow
```

### Phase 3: Mandatory Workflow Enforcement

#### 3.1 Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Blocking commits**: Prevent commits without ADR when architectural changes detected
- **PR requirements**: Require ADR creation/updates before PR merge
- **Status checks**: GitHub status checks that fail without proper ADRs

#### 3.2 User Experience Flow
1. Developer makes architectural changes
2. Hook detects potential ADR material
3. System prompts: "Architectural changes detected. ADR required."
4. Developer creates ADR using provided template
5. ADR reviewed as part of normal review process
6. Changes proceed after ADR approval

#### 3.3 Escape Hatch & Override
- `--no-adr` flag for exceptional cases
- Require justification comment when overriding
- Log all overrides for audit purposes

### Phase 4: Integration & Tooling

#### 4.1 CLI Tool (`adr` command)
```bash
adr init           # Initialize ADR system in project
adr new "title"    # Create new ADR
adr list          # List all ADRs
adr show 001      # Display specific ADR
adr search "term" # Search ADR content
adr check         # Check for ADR requirements
```

#### 4.2 Editor Integration
- VS Code extension for ADR management
- Syntax highlighting for ADR markdown
- ADR navigation and linking

#### 4.3 Documentation Integration
- Generate ADR index automatically
- Link ADRs to related documentation
- Include ADRs in project documentation builds

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic ADR Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Create `.adrs/` directory structure
2. Design and implement ADR template
3. Create example ADR (decision to implement ADR system)
4. Implement basic `adr` CLI tool for creation/management

### Step 2: Detection Logic (Week 1-2)  
1. Analyze codebase for architectural patterns
2. Implement change detection algorithms
3. Create configuration for custom detection rules
4. Test detection accuracy and tune thresholds

### Step 3: Hook Implementation (Week 2)
1. Implement Git pre-commit hooks
2. Create GitHub Actions workflow
3. Add configuration options and escape hatches
4. Test hook integration thoroughly

### Step 4: Workflow Integration (Week 2-3)
1. Integrate with existing development workflow
2. Add PR template updates for ADR requirements  
3. Create documentation and team onboarding materials
4. Implement feedback collection and iteration

### Step 5: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)
1. ADR linking and relationship tracking
2. Status change workflows (deprecation, superseding)
3. ADR analytics and reporting
4. Integration with documentation generation

## Technical Considerations

### Detection Algorithm Challenges
- **False positives**: Avoid flagging minor changes as architectural
- **False negatives**: Ensure important decisions aren't missed
- **Context sensitivity**: Different rules for different project areas
- **Performance**: Minimize impact on development velocity

### Hook Implementation Details
- **Language agnostic**: Support multiple programming languages
- **Configuration**: Allow project-specific customization
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when hooks fail
- **Version control**: Hook configuration tracked in repository

### User Experience Priorities
- **Minimal friction**: Don't slow down normal development
- **Clear prompts**: Make ADR requirements obvious and actionable
- **Good defaults**: Sensible detection rules out of the box
- **Easy customization**: Allow teams to adapt to their needs

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics
- ADR creation rate vs. architectural changes detected
- Time from architectural decision to ADR documentation  
- Hook false positive/negative rates
- Developer satisfaction with ADR workflow

### Quality Metrics
- ADR completeness and quality scores
- Usage of ADRs in decision-making processes
- Reduction in architectural question resolution time
- Long-term architectural decision tracking

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Developer Resistance
**Mitigation**: 
- Emphasize value through examples and training
- Minimize workflow disruption
- Provide escape hatches for exceptional cases
- Collect and address feedback continuously

### Risk: Over-Detection (Alert Fatigue)
**Mitigation**:
- Careful tuning of detection algorithms
- Machine learning to improve accuracy over time
- Easy customization of detection rules
- Regular review and adjustment of thresholds

### Risk: Under-Detection (Missed Decisions)
**Mitigation**:
- Conservative detection rules (err on side of caution)
- Manual ADR creation always available
- Regular review of non-ADR architectural changes
- Team training on when ADRs are needed

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5: Intelligence & Analytics
- Machine learning for better change detection
- ADR impact analysis and metrics
- Automated ADR quality assessment
- Integration with project management tools

### Phase 6: Collaboration Features  
- ADR discussion and comment threads
- ADR approval workflows
- Integration with code review tools
- Real-time collaboration on ADR documents

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to implementing ADRs with automated detection and mandatory workflow integration while maintaining developer productivity and satisfaction.
