# Issue #1: Implement ADR (Architectural Decision Record) system with mandatory hooks

**Status**: OPEN
**URL**: https://github.com/maphilipps/compound-engineering-setup/issues/1

## Problem to solve

We need a systematic way to capture and maintain Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in the project to document important architectural decisions and their rationale. This will help future team members understand past decisions without blind acceptance or reversal.

## Requirements

### Core ADR System
- ADRs should be stored in the `.adrs/` directory
- Follow standard ADR template format (Title, Context, Decision, Status, Consequences)
- Use sequential numbering (adr-001.md, adr-002.md, etc.)
- Lightweight Markdown format, 1-2 pages max per ADR

### Hook Integration  
- Implement a hook system that triggers when tasks are completed
- Hook must detect if completed work contains ADR-worthy material
- When ADR material is identified, creating an ADR should be mandatory
- Integration with existing workflow and tooling

## Key Details
- Based on Cognitect's ADR methodology: https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html
- ADR Template includes: Title, Context, Decision, Status, Consequences
- Sequential numbering and monotonic ordering
- Hook mechanism for automated detection of architectural changes
- Mandatory workflow when ADR-worthy changes are detected

## Implementation Notes
- Create ADR template and tooling for easy creation
- Design hook mechanism for task completion detection  
- Integrate with existing project workflow
- Ensure proper status tracking (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)

Based on the requirements, this is at the stage of: ready for planning

Starting implementation planning phase. Will create detailed technical plan for ADR system implementation.

## Implementation Plan Complete

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the ADR system:

ðŸ“‹ **Plan Document**: [.thoughts/shared/plans/adr-system-implementation.md](https://github.com/maphilipps/compound-engineering-setup/blob/main/.thoughts/shared/plans/adr-system-implementation.md)

### Key Components:
- **Phase 1**: Core ADR infrastructure (.adrs/ directory, templates, CLI tool)
- **Phase 2**: Hook system for automated detection of architectural changes  
- **Phase 3**: Mandatory workflow enforcement with escape hatches
- **Phase 4**: Integration & tooling (CLI, editor support, documentation)

### Implementation Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Week 1: Basic infrastructure + detection logic
- Week 2: Hook implementation + workflow integration  
- Week 3-4: Advanced features + team onboarding

The plan follows Cognitect's ADR methodology and includes technical details for:
- Change detection algorithms
- Git hook integration
- GitHub Actions workflows
- User experience design
- Risk mitigation strategies

Ready to move to implementation phase. ðŸš€
