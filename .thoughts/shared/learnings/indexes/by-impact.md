# Learning Index by Impact Level

This index categorizes learnings by their organizational impact level for prioritized review.

## High Impact (Organizational)
*Learnings that affect entire organization or multiple teams*

- **Compound Learning Synthesis Framework** (2025-09-03): 4-criteria optimization approach (Correctness, Completeness, Size, Trajectory) enables systematic workflow improvement
- **Workflow Performance Gap Pattern** (2025-09-03): Compound-enhanced workflows (100% success) significantly outperform basic workflows (0-43% success)

## Medium Impact (Team/Project)  
*Learnings that affect current team or project outcomes*

- **Learning Infrastructure Utilization Gap** (2025-09-03): Complete infrastructure exists but requires activation of learning commands in workflows
- **Cross-Workflow Context Sharing Need** (2025-09-03): Individual workflows operate in silos, limiting compound learning effect
- **Tool Usage Logging Success** (2025-09-03): PostToolUse hook captures 166+ operations effectively, providing rich data for pattern analysis

## Low Impact (Individual/Local)
*Learnings that improve individual productivity or local workflows*

- *No low-impact learnings captured yet*

## Impact Assessment Criteria

### High Impact
- Affects multiple teams or entire organization
