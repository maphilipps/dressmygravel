# 2. Adopt Compound Engineering Development Practices

Date: 2025-09-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a development approach that builds systems which create systems, where every action makes future actions faster, safer, and more intelligent. Traditional development focuses on individual solutions, but we need compound improvements that accelerate exponentially.

The Every.to article "My AI had already fixed the code before I saw it" demonstrates AI systems that proactively prevent problems rather than just reacting to them. This requires:

1. **Predictive vs Reactive Intelligence**: AI that anticipates and fixes issues before they manifest
2. **Context Evolution**: Living documentation that grows smarter with each interaction
3. **Pattern Codification**: Successful approaches automatically becoming reusable systems
4. **Compound Learning**: Each improvement amplifying previous improvements

## Decision

We will implement Compound Engineering practices through a 4-Phase Lane Model:

1. **Issue Creation** (`/create-issue`) - Structured problem definition
2. **Research Phase** (`/research`) - Codebase analysis + Context7 + web research
3. **Planning Phase** (`/plan`) - Agent-aware implementation planning
4. **Implementation Phase** (`/work`) - Agent-orchestrated development

**Supporting Infrastructure:**
- Memory-bank system for compound learning capture
- Hook-based quality gates for ADR compliance and pattern extraction
- Local workflow directories (.work/) for phase management
- Agent discovery and orchestration for optimal implementation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Exponential Learning**: Each project builds intelligence for future projects
- **Proactive Quality**: Problems prevented before they occur through predictive analysis
- **Agent Optimization**: Systematic improvement in AI agent selection and coordination
- **Context Intelligence**: Documentation that evolves and improves with usage
- **Pattern Reuse**: Successful approaches automatically codified for future use

### Negative
- **Initial Setup Overhead**: Time investment in infrastructure and process establishment
- **Learning Curve**: Team adaptation to new workflow and tooling
- **Complexity Management**: Need for careful balance between automation and human oversight

### Neutral
- **Process Discipline**: Requires consistent adherence to 4-phase workflow
- **Tool Dependencies**: Reliance on Claude Code hooks and agent ecosystem

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Traditional Agile Development
- **Pros**: Established practices, immediate productivity
- **Cons**: Linear improvement, reactive problem-solving, no compound benefits
- **Why rejected**: Doesn't achieve exponential capability growth

### Option B: Pure AI Automation
- **Pros**: Maximum automation, minimal human intervention
- **Cons**: No learning capture, no quality evolution, black box outcomes
- **Why rejected**: Misses the compound learning opportunity

## Implementation Notes

1. **Phase Control**: Commands manage their own phases, hooks provide quality gates
2. **ADR Integration**: All architectural changes must pass ADR compliance checks
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Planning phase must specify agent assignments and coordination
4. **Learning Capture**: All successful patterns automatically feed back into system intelligence

## Compound Engineering Impact

This decision establishes the foundation for exponential development capability growth. Each implementation cycle will:
- Improve agent selection algorithms
- Enhance pattern recognition systems
- Evolve context intelligence
- Strengthen quality prediction mechanisms

Future similar decisions will be faster and more accurate due to the compound learning captured from this implementation.
