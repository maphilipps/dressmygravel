# ADR-001: Implement Architectural Decision Records (ADR) System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The compound-engineering-setup repository serves as a foundation for multiple engineering projects and contains critical architectural decisions that affect the entire development workflow. Currently, these architectural decisions are either:

1. Undocumented, leading to repeated discussions and confusion
2. Scattered across various documents, making them hard to find
3. Lost in commit messages or pull request discussions
4. Known only to specific team members

This creates several problems:
- New team members struggle to understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Architectural decisions are re-debated without considering previous context
- Technical debt accumulates when the rationale for decisions is forgotten
- Onboarding takes longer due to lack of documented decision history

The engineering team has grown and needs a systematic way to capture, track, and reference architectural decisions. We need a lightweight, developer-friendly system that integrates with our existing Git-based workflow.

## Decision
We will implement an Architectural Decision Records (ADR) system using the Cognitect methodology with the following components:

1. **Standardized Format**: Use a consistent markdown template for all ADRs
2. **Version Control Integration**: Store ADRs in the repository alongside code
3. **Automated Tooling**: Create CLI tools to simplify ADR creation and management
4. **Phased Implementation**: Start with core infrastructure, then add automation and enforcement

The ADR system will:
- Store all ADRs in a `.adrs/` directory at the repository root
- Use sequential numbering (adr-001, adr-002, etc.)
- Follow a standard template with Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences sections
- Integrate with existing development workflows through Git hooks and CI/CD
- Provide tooling for easy ADR creation, listing, and searching

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Architectural decisions will be documented and searchable
- New team members can understand the reasoning behind technical choices
- Reduced time spent re-debating previously settled architectural questions
- Better alignment between team members on technical direction
- Historical context preserved for future architectural decisions

**Negative:**
- Additional overhead for developers when making architectural changes
- Initial setup and learning curve for the team
- Maintenance burden for keeping ADRs up to date
- Risk of creating process friction if not implemented thoughtfully

**Neutral:**
- ADRs become part of the code review process
- Technical decisions require more documentation upfront
- Architecture discussions become more structured and formal

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement ADR tooling to minimize friction
- Start with voluntary adoption to build familiarity
- Provide clear guidelines on when ADRs are required vs. optional
- Regular retrospectives to adjust the process based on team feedback
