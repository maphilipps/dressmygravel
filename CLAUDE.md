# CLAUDE.md
<!-- Generated by Claude Conductor v1.1.2 -->

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical Context (Read First)
- **Tech Stack**: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS (minified production build)
- **Main File**: `dressmyrun.js` - 2.1MB minified JavaScript bundle (436 lines)
- **Core Mechanic**: Minified frontend application for dressmyrun.com
- **Key Integration**: Sentry error tracking, React JSX runtime
- **Platform Support**: Web browser application
- **DO NOT**: Attempt to edit minified JavaScript directly

## Session Startup Checklist
**IMPORTANT**: At the start of each session, check these items:
1. **Check TASKS.md** - Look for any IN_PROGRESS or BLOCKED tasks from previous sessions
2. **Review recent JOURNAL.md entries** - Scan last 2-3 entries for context
3. **If resuming work**: Load the current task context from TASKS.md before proceeding

## Table of Contents
1. [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Tech stack, folder structure, infrastructure
2. [Design Tokens](DESIGN.md) - Colors, typography, visual system
3. [UI/UX Patterns](UIUX.md) - Components, interactions, accessibility
4. [Runtime Config](CONFIG.md) - Environment variables, feature flags
5. [Data Model](DATA_MODEL.md) - Database schema, entities, relationships
6. [API Contracts](API.md) - Endpoints, request/response formats, auth
7. [Build & Release](BUILD.md) - Build process, deployment, CI/CD
8. [Testing Guide](TEST.md) - Test strategies, E2E scenarios, coverage
9. [Operational Playbooks](PLAYBOOKS/DEPLOY.md) - Deployment, rollback, monitoring
10. [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Code style, PR process, conventions
11. [Error Ledger](ERRORS.md) - Critical P0/P1 error tracking
12. [Task Management](TASKS.md) - Active tasks, phase tracking, context preservation

## Quick Reference
**Production Bundle**: `dressmyrun.js:1-436` - Minified JavaScript application
**Documentation**: `CONDUCTOR.md` - Project conductor documentation
**Architecture**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture notes
**Journal**: `JOURNAL.md` - Engineering journal
**ADRs**: `doc/architecture/decisions/` - Architecture decision records

## Current State
- [x] Production build deployed (dressmyrun.js)
- [ ] Source code unavailable (only minified bundle present)
- [ ] Development environment setup needed
- [ ] Project reconstruction required from production build

## Development Workflow
1. **Note**: Source code not available - only production build present
2. To work with this project, source code needs to be recovered or recreated
3. The minified JavaScript should not be edited directly
4. Consider setting up a new development environment
5. Use existing documentation as reference for project structure

## Task Templates
### 1. [Common Task Name]
1. Step with file:line reference
2. Step with specific action
3. Test step
4. Documentation update

[Include 3-5 templates]

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)
❌ **Don't edit dressmyrun.js directly** - It's minified production code
❌ **Don't attempt to reverse-engineer from minified code** - Inefficient and error-prone
❌ **Don't deploy changes without source code** - No way to rebuild properly
❌ **Don't modify production bundle** - Will break on next deployment
❌ **Don't work without version control** - Need proper source management

## Journal Update Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Update JOURNAL.md regularly throughout our work sessions:
- After completing any significant feature or fix
- When encountering and resolving errors
- At the end of each work session
- When making architectural decisions
- Format: What/Why/How/Issues/Result structure

## Task Management Integration
**How TASKS.md and JOURNAL.md work together**:
1. **Active Work**: TASKS.md tracks current/incomplete tasks with full context
2. **Completed Work**: When tasks complete, they generate JOURNAL.md entries with `|TASK:ID|` tags
3. **History**: JOURNAL.md preserves complete task history even if Claude Code is reinstalled
4. **Context Recovery**: Search JOURNAL.md for `|TASK:` to see all completed tasks over time
5. **Clean Handoffs**: TASKS.md always shows what needs to be resumed or completed

## Version History
- **v1.0.0** - Initial release
- **v1.1.0** - Feature added (see JOURNAL.md YYYY-MM-DD)
