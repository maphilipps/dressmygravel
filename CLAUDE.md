# CLAUDE.md
<!-- Generated by Claude Conductor v1.1.2 -->

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical Context (Read First)
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Project Type**: Weather-based clothing recommendation PWA for gravel cyclists
- **Architecture Pattern**: App Router, Server Components where possible, Client Components for interactivity
- **Data Flow**: IP Geolocation → Weather API → Clothing Engine → UI Components
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching at all layers (Browser, SWR, API, CDN)
- **CRITICAL**: This is a clone/adaptation of dressmyrun.com for gravel biking
- **REFERENCE**: dressmyrun.js (minified bundle) serves as functional reference only - DO NOT edit directly

## Session Startup Checklist
**IMPORTANT**: At the start of each session, check these items:
1. **Check TASKS.md** - Look for any IN_PROGRESS or BLOCKED tasks from previous sessions
2. **Review recent JOURNAL.md entries** - Scan last 2-3 entries for context
3. **If resuming work**: Load the current task context from TASKS.md before proceeding

## Rules Usage

This project uses comprehensive Claude rules to guide development patterns and best practices. The rules are located in `.claude/rules/` and cover:

### Core Development Principles
- **Compound Engineering Core** (`.claude/rules/compound-engineering-core.md`): Core principles for exponential improvement
- **ADR Workflow** (`.claude/rules/adr-workflow.md`): Architecture Decision Records process
- **GitHub Compound Workflow** (`.claude/rules/github-compound-workflow.md`): Enhanced GitHub workflow with learning loops

### Project-Specific Rules (DressMyGravel)
- **API Integration Patterns** (`.claude/rules/api-integration-patterns.md`): Weather API integration, caching strategies, cost optimization
- **UI Component Patterns** (`.claude/rules/ui-component-patterns.md`): Next.js 14, Shadcn/ui patterns, mobile-first development
- **Performance Requirements** (`.claude/rules/performance-requirements.md`): Core Web Vitals, optimization strategies, monitoring
- **Security Practices** (`.claude/rules/security-practices.md`): API key management, Git security, learned from token exposure incident
- **GitHub Workflow** (`.claude/rules/github-workflow.md`): Issue management, branch strategy, PR standards specific to this project
- **Clothing Recommendation Logic** (`.claude/rules/clothing-recommendation-logic.md`): Temperature zones, weather modifiers, gravel-specific factors

**Important**: Always reference these rules when working on the project. They contain critical learnings from the initial setup session, including the API token exposure incident and recovery.

## Quick Reference
**Reference Bundle**: `dressmyrun.js` - Minified reference implementation (DO NOT EDIT)
**Project Spec**: `docs/project-spec.md` - Complete project specification
**GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/maphilipps/dressmygravel
**Issues Board**: https://github.com/maphilipps/dressmygravel/issues
**Architecture**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture notes
**Journal**: `JOURNAL.md` - Engineering journal
**ADRs**: `doc/architecture/decisions/` - Architecture decision records

### Key Directories (to be created)
- `app/` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `components/` - React components (UI, features)
- `lib/` - Business logic, utilities, services
- `data/` - Static data (clothing items, products)
- `public/` - Static assets (images, icons)

## Implementation Rules (MANDATORY)

### API & Data Handling
- **ALWAYS round coordinates to 0.1°** for weather caching efficiency
- **CACHE weather data for minimum 3 hours** - API calls are limited
- **USE OpenWeatherMap API** as primary, WeatherAPI.com as fallback
- **IMPLEMENT retry logic** with exponential backoff for API failures

### Clothing Logic Rules
- **Temperature zones are FIXED**: HOT >25°C, WARM 15-25°C, COOL 5-15°C, COLD <5°C
- **Gravel rides are LONGER than runs** - Adjust clothing for extended exposure
- **ALWAYS include helmet as required** - Safety first for cycling
- **Modifiers are CUMULATIVE** - Rain + Wind = both modifications apply

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Mobile breakpoint is 640px** - Test everything mobile-first
- **Use Shadcn's Card component** for all weather/clothing displays
- **Dark mode is REQUIRED** - Use Shadcn's theme system
- **Loading states are MANDATORY** - Never show blank screens

### Performance Targets
- **Lighthouse score MUST be >90** on all metrics
- **Initial load MUST be <2.5s** on 3G connection
- **Images MUST use WebP** with fallback to JPEG
- **Bundle size MUST be <200KB** for initial JavaScript

## Development Workflow (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
When implementing any feature in this codebase, you MUST:
1. **ALWAYS work in feature branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **ALWAYS check existing patterns first** - Look at similar implementations before creating new ones
3. **ALWAYS use Shadcn/ui components** - Don't create custom UI components if Shadcn has one
4. **ALWAYS implement caching for API calls** - Use the established caching patterns in lib/cache
5. **ALWAYS write TypeScript interfaces first** - Define types before implementation
6. **ALWAYS test on mobile viewport** - Mobile-first is mandatory
7. **ALWAYS use environment variables for secrets** - Never hardcode API keys

## Task Templates
### 1. Implement New UI Component
1. Install Shadcn component: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]`
2. Create wrapper in `components/[feature]/[component].tsx`
3. Add Storybook story in `[component].stories.tsx`
4. Write tests in `[component].test.tsx`
5. Update component documentation

### 2. Add API Endpoint
1. Create route handler in `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts`
2. Add TypeScript types in `lib/types/[feature].ts`
3. Implement caching strategy in handler
4. Write API tests
5. Document in API specification

### 3. Implement Feature from Issue
1. Read issue requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[issue-number]`
3. Write tests first (TDD approach)
4. Implement feature
5. Verify all tests pass
6. Create PR with "Fixes #[issue-number]"

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)
❌ **NEVER hardcode API keys** - Will be rejected in PR
❌ **NEVER create custom UI components when Shadcn has one** - Consistency matters
❌ **NEVER make uncached API calls** - Every external call must be cached
❌ **NEVER use 'any' type in TypeScript** - Proper types or generics only
❌ **NEVER ignore mobile viewport** - Desktop-only features will be rejected
❌ **NEVER skip loading states** - Users must always see feedback
❌ **NEVER commit .env files** - Use .env.example for templates

## Journal Update Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Update JOURNAL.md regularly throughout our work sessions:
- After completing any significant feature or fix
- When encountering and resolving errors
- At the end of each work session
- When making architectural decisions
- Format: What/Why/How/Issues/Result structure

## Task Management Integration
**How TASKS.md and JOURNAL.md work together**:
1. **Active Work**: TASKS.md tracks current/incomplete tasks with full context
2. **Completed Work**: When tasks complete, they generate JOURNAL.md entries with `|TASK:ID|` tags
3. **History**: JOURNAL.md preserves complete task history even if Claude Code is reinstalled
4. **Context Recovery**: Search JOURNAL.md for `|TASK:` to see all completed tasks over time
5. **Clean Handoffs**: TASKS.md always shows what needs to be resumed or completed

## Version History
- **v1.0.0** - Initial release
- **v1.1.0** - Feature added (see JOURNAL.md YYYY-MM-DD)
