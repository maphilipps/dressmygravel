# GitHub Workflow for DressMyGravel

**Objective:** Maintain clear project structure through GitHub Issues, Milestones, and consistent development workflows that create traceable, manageable progress.

## Issue Management Structure

### Issue Template Hierarchy
Based on our created issues, follow this structure:

```markdown
## Epic Issues (Milestones)
- MVP Launch (Milestone)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Core Weather Integration (#1)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Clothing Recommendation Engine (#2)
  â”œâ”€â”€ User Interface Development (#3)
  â””â”€â”€ Testing & Deployment (#4)

## Task Breakdown Pattern
Epic Issue â†’ Feature Issues â†’ Implementation Tasks

Example:
#1 Core Weather Integration (Epic)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Implement Apple Weather API client
  â”œâ”€â”€ Create caching layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ Build fallback strategies
  â””â”€â”€ Add weather data models
```

### Issue Creation Standards
```markdown
# CORRECT: Clear, actionable issue
Title: Implement Apple Weather API integration with caching

## Description
Integrate Apple Weather API to fetch current conditions with aggressive caching to minimize API costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Weather data fetched for given coordinates
- [ ] Results cached for minimum 3 hours
- [ ] Coordinates rounded to 0.1 decimal places
- [ ] Fallback to stale data if API fails
- [ ] Error handling for rate limits

## Technical Details
- Use Next.js Route Handlers for API routes
- Implement Redis/Upstash for caching
- Follow temperature zone classifications from requirements

## Related Issues
- Blocks: #2 (Clothing Recommendations)
- Related to: #3 (UI Development)
```

### Issue Labels System
```typescript
const labelStructure = {
  // Type labels
  'type:feature': 'New functionality',
  'type:bug': 'Something broken',
  'type:enhancement': 'Improvement to existing feature',
  'type:documentation': 'Documentation updates',

  // Priority labels
  'priority:critical': 'MVP blocker',
  'priority:high': 'Important for launch',
  'priority:medium': 'Nice to have',
  'priority:low': 'Future enhancement',

  // Status labels
  'status:blocked': 'Waiting on dependency',
  'status:in-progress': 'Currently being worked on',
  'status:review': 'In code review',
  'status:testing': 'Being tested',

  // Component labels
  'component:api': 'API/Backend',
  'component:ui': 'User Interface',
  'component:cache': 'Caching layer',
  'component:auth': 'Authentication',
};
```

## Milestone Management

### MVP Milestone Structure

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/1-apple-weather-integration
feature/2-clothing-recommendations
feature/3-ui-shadcn-setup

# Bug fix branches
fix/5-cache-invalidation-issue
fix/6-mobile-layout-break

# Enhancement branches
enhance/7-add-wind-chill-factor
enhance/8-improve-loading-states

# NEVER work on main directly
main  # Protected branch, requires PR
```

### Branch Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create issue first
gh issue create --title "Implement weather caching" --body "..."

# 2. Create branch from issue
git checkout -b feature/10-weather-caching

# 3. Work on branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement 3-hour weather caching

- Round coordinates to 0.1 decimal places
- Add Redis caching layer
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern

Refs #10"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/10-weather-caching
gh pr create --title "Feature: Weather caching implementation" \
  --body "Closes #10" --milestone "MVP Launch"
```
