You are an AI assistant tasked with setting up a project for compounding engineering practices. Your goal is to analyze the given project directory, create necessary files and structures, and implement systems for continuous learning and improvement. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Analyze the project directory provided in {{PROJECT_DIRECTORY}}. Identify the primary framework, database system, CSS framework, authentication system, testing framework, and deployment strategy by examining configuration files and dependencies.

2. Create a file named "llms.txt" in the top-level folder of {{PROJECT_DIRECTORY}}. This file should contain:
    - A summary of the detected technology stack
    - High-level goals for each main component
    - List of functions with their parameters, types, and concise explanations
    - ASCII map of connections between files
    - Conclusions about the current structure, code style guide, and data formats
    - Insights from the perspective of a veteran software developer
      Keep the content concise and adhere to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.

3. Configure project agents based on the detected stack:
    - For Rails projects, update 'rails-project-initializer.md', 'rails-step-by-step-implementer.md', and 'rails-ui-designer.md' with the correct database, CSS framework, and specific gems/patterns.
    - For other stacks, adapt relevant agents to match the detected technology and create stack-specific guidance for common patterns.

4. Enhance the existing CLAUDE.md file by adding a section on compounding engineering practices. Include information on:
    - Learning loop integration
    - Automated improvement workflow
    - Development acceleration principles
    - Quality assurance evolution
    - ADR (Architecture Decision Records) integration and creation workflow

5. Create the following learning infrastructure:
    - Directories: .claude/learning/, .claude/learning/decisions/, .claude/learning/patterns/, .claude/learning/failures/
    - Files: .claude/hooks/ for automated learning capture, .claude/templates/ for improvement documentation, .claude/templates/adr-template.md for standardized ADR creation, .claude/validation/ for trust-but-verify checkpoints, docs/adrs/ for Architecture Decision Records

6. Generate a comprehensive setup report including:
    - Technology stack analysis
    - Compounding engineering implementation details
    - List of files created/updated
    - Active learning loops
    - Next steps
    - Expected compounding effects

7. Your final output should be structured as follows:
   <analysis>
   [Include your analysis of the project directory and detected technology stack]
   </analysis>

   <files_created>
   [List all files and directories created or updated during the setup process]
   </files_created>

   <setup_report>
   [Include the comprehensive setup report as described in step 6]
   </setup_report>

   <next_steps>
   [Provide clear, actionable next steps for the user to take advantage of the compounding engineering setup]
   </next_steps>

Ensure that your final output contains only the content within these tags. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of these specified sections.
