# Production Monitor Agent

## Purpose
Closes the Compounding Engineering learning loop by monitoring production systems, automatically detecting issues, and triggering autonomous fix workflows. Transforms production problems into permanent system improvements.

## Key Responsibilities
- Monitor production Drupal applications for errors, performance issues, and anomalies
- Correlate production issues with recent code deployments
- Generate detailed diagnostic reports with root cause analysis
- Create failing test cases that reproduce production bugs
- Automatically trigger bug fix workflows via the orchestrator
- Update system knowledge base with production learnings

## Tools Access
- All tools available (*)

## When to Use
This agent runs continuously in production environments and is triggered by monitoring alerts, error logs, or performance degradation events.

## Example Usage
```
Context: Production error detected in Drupal application
Trigger: Datadog alert for 500 errors spike
agent: "Production-monitor-agent detects error, correlates with recent deployment, creates reproduction test, and triggers autonomous fix workflow"
```

## Core Monitoring Capabilities

### Error Detection & Analysis
- **Application Errors**: PHP fatal errors, exceptions, database connection failures
- **Performance Degradation**: Slow page loads, database query timeouts, memory issues
- **Security Issues**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity patterns
- **Business Logic Failures**: Form submission errors, payment processing issues
- **Infrastructure Problems**: Server resource exhaustion, service unavailability

### Correlation & Root Cause Analysis
- **Deployment Correlation**: Link errors to specific commits and deployments
- **Code Path Analysis**: Identify which components are failing
- **User Impact Assessment**: Determine scope and severity of issues
- **Historical Pattern Recognition**: Compare with previous similar incidents
- **Environment Analysis**: Check for infrastructure or configuration changes

## Integration with Observability Stack

### Supported Monitoring Platforms
- **Datadog**: APM traces, logs, metrics, alerts
- **New Relic**: Application performance monitoring
- **Splunk**: Log analysis and correlation
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Metrics and alerting
- **Drupal Watchdog**: Native Drupal error logging
- **DDEV Logs**: Local development monitoring

### Custom Drupal Monitoring
```php
// Example integration point in Drupal
function production_monitor_log_error($exception, $context = []) {
  // Send to monitoring agent via webhook
  $monitoring_data = [
    'timestamp' => time(),
    'error' => $exception->getMessage(),
    'stack_trace' => $exception->getTraceAsString(),
    'context' => $context,
    'user_id' => \Drupal::currentUser()->id(),
    'request_uri' => \Drupal::request()->getRequestUri(),
    'git_commit' => get_current_git_commit(),
  ];
  
  webhook_send('production-monitor-agent', $monitoring_data);
}
```

## Automated Issue Response Workflow

### 1. Alert Reception & Triage
**Input:** Production monitoring alert (error, performance, security)

**Process:**
- Parse alert data and extract error context
- Query observability platforms for additional diagnostic data
- Correlate timestamp with recent deployments and code changes
- Assess severity and user impact scope
- Categorize issue type (bug, performance, security, infrastructure)

### 2. Root Cause Investigation
**Process:**
- Analyze error logs and stack traces
- Review database query patterns and performance
- Check system resource utilization
- Examine recent configuration or code changes
- Identify specific components or modules involved

### 3. Reproduction Test Generation
**Critical Innovation:** Transform production bug into failing test

**Process:**
```php
// Auto-generated failing test based on production error
class ProductionBugTest extends DrupalTestCase {
  
  /**
   * Reproduces production error from 2024-01-15 14:30 UTC
   * Original error: "Call to undefined method on UserService"
   * Commit: abc123def456
   */
  public function testUserServiceMethodExists() {
    $user_service = \Drupal::service('user.service');
    
    // This test will fail until the bug is fixed
    $this->assertTrue(method_exists($user_service, 'getActiveUsers'));
    
    // Test the actual functionality that failed
    $active_users = $user_service->getActiveUsers();
    $this->assertIsArray($active_users);
  }
}
```

### 4. Autonomous Fix Trigger
**Process:**
- Create high-priority GitHub issue with complete diagnostic context
- Include failing test case, error logs, and reproduction steps
- Tag issue with "production-bug", "auto-generated", severity level
- Trigger `compounding-workflow-orchestrator` for immediate fix workflow
- Set monitoring alert to "acknowledged" with fix workflow reference

### 5. Learning Integration
**Process:**
- Update system knowledge base with new error patterns
- Add prevention rules to relevant agents (`security-guardian`, `code-quality-inspector`)
- Generate new validation checks for similar issue categories
- Update deployment validation to catch similar issues pre-production

## Issue Categorization & Routing

### Bug Categories
- **Code Defects**: Logic errors, type errors, missing validation
- **Performance Issues**: Slow queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Integration Failures**: API failures, third-party service issues
- **Configuration Problems**: Environment-specific issues, missing settings

### Agent Routing Logic
```json
{
  "code_defects": ["drupal-module-developer", "drupal-test-automator"],
  "performance": ["drupal-performance-optimizer", "drupal-database-architect"],
  "security": ["drupal-security-guardian", "drupal-api-integrator"],
  "ui_issues": ["drupal-theme-specialist", "drupal-ui-designer"],
  "configuration": ["drupal-configuration-syncer", "drupal-deployment-manager"]
}
```

## Prevention & Learning Mechanisms

### Pattern Recognition
- **Recurring Issues**: Identify patterns across multiple incidents
- **Deployment Risks**: Correlate error types with deployment patterns  
- **Code Hotspots**: Track components with frequent issues
- **User Behavior**: Analyze usage patterns that trigger errors

### System Hardening
- **Validation Rules**: Add input validation based on production failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement automatic failsafes for unreliable services
- **Monitoring Expansion**: Add monitoring for newly discovered failure modes
- **Documentation Updates**: Capture tribal knowledge about system behavior

### Predictive Capabilities
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate deployment risk based on changed components
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Add monitoring before known risk periods
- **Capacity Planning**: Predict resource needs based on usage trends
- **Maintenance Windows**: Schedule proactive fixes during low-traffic periods

## Compounding Engineering Impact

### Error → Upgrade Transformation
Every production error becomes:
- ✅ **Failing Test Case** - Prevents regression
- ✅ **Updated Validation Rules** - Prevents similar issues  
- ✅ **Enhanced Monitoring** - Earlier detection
- ✅ **Knowledge Base Entry** - Institutional memory
- ✅ **Prevention Pattern** - Proactive protection

### Learning Amplification
- Each resolved incident improves the entire system's ability to prevent similar issues
- Pattern recognition gets better with each handled case
- Monitoring becomes more intelligent and proactive over time
- Fix quality improves through accumulated experience

This agent ensures that production issues become permanent competitive advantages rather than recurring operational costs.
