# Consolidated Learnings

This file contains curated, summarized, and actionable insights derived from `raw_reflection_log.md`. This is the primary, refined knowledge base for long-term compound engineering use.

## Every.to Article Integration Learnings

### Compound Engineering Core Insights
**Pattern: Proactive vs Reactive AI**
- Focus on preventing problems before they occur, not just learning from failures
- Build systems that anticipate and fix issues automatically
- *Rationale:* "AI had already fixed the code before I saw it" - predictive intelligence over reactive responses

**Pattern: Context Evolution**
- Project context (CLAUDE.md) should evolve continuously based on work patterns
- Each successful pattern should automatically become a reusable rule
- *Rationale:* Static documentation becomes stale; living context improves with each interaction

**Pattern: Systems That Create Systems**
- Every solution should make the next similar problem easier to solve
- Focus on meta-improvements that compound exponentially
- *Rationale:* Individual optimizations vs systematic capability enhancement
