TaskRef: "Every.to Article Integration - Complete Compound Engineering System Implementation"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented 4-Phase Lane Model with full agent orchestration
- Hook-based quality gates provide seamless ADR compliance and learning capture
- Context7 + Web research integration creates comprehensive intelligence gathering
- Agent discovery and mapping enables optimal task execution strategies
- Memory-bank system provides foundation for exponential learning capture

Difficulties:
- adr-tools command-line integration required manual file creation due to vim timeout
- Hook configuration needed careful coordination between PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop events
- Agent orchestration planning required detailed capability mapping for 46 agents

Successes:
- Complete operational implementation of Every.to "AI fixes before you see it" vision
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code hooks and agent ecosystem
- ADR system properly initialized with compound engineering foundation decision
- Quality gates automatically enforce compliance and capture learning
- Local workflow directories provide clean phase separation

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Agent selection algorithms should learn from successful combinations
- Quality gate evolution patterns for self-improving validation
- Context mutation workflows for automatic CLAUDE.md evolution
- Predictive analysis patterns for proactive issue prevention
