# Project Context for AI Development

## Technology Stack
Primary: rails
Framework: Ruby on Rails
Database: 
CSS: standard
Authentication: custom

## Architecture Patterns
- Follows Rails conventions and best practices
- Test-driven development with automated feedback loops
- Continuous learning from code reviews and failures
- AI-assisted development with human oversight

## Development Workflow
1. AI agents handle routine tasks (testing, review, implementation)
2. Human oversight ensures quality and architectural coherence  
3. Every failure becomes a learning opportunity captured in rules
4. Code reviews feed back into AI knowledge for future improvements

## Key Principles
- Compounding Engineering: Systems that improve systems
- Fail Fast, Learn Faster: Convert every error into permanent improvement
- Context Over Configuration: Maintain lean, project-specific AI guidance
- Trust but Verify: AI autonomy with human validation checkpoints

## Current Focus Areas
- Implementing robust testing patterns
- Establishing clear architectural boundaries
- Creating feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Maintaining code quality through automated reviews
